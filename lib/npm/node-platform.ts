Windows and WSL environments.

If you are installing with npm, you can try not copying the "node_modules"
directory when you copy the files over, and running "npm ci" or "npm install"
on the destination platform after the copy. Or you could consider using yarn
instead of npm which has built-in support for installing a package on multiple
platforms simultaneously.

If you are installing with yarn, you can try listing both this platform and the
other platform in your ".yarnrc.yml" file using the "supportedArchitectures"
feature: https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc/#supportedArchitectures

2 is Apple's on-the-fly x86_64-to-arm64 translation service).

If you are installing with npm, you can try ensuring that both npm and node are
not running under Rosetta 2 and then reinstalling esbuild. This likely involves
changing how you installed npm and/or node. For example, installing node with
the universal installer here should work: https://nodejs.org/en/download/. Or
you could consider using yarn instead of npm which has built-in support for
installing a package on multiple platforms simultaneously.

Another alternative is to use the "esbuild-wasm" package instead, which works
the same way on all platforms. But it comes with a heavy performance cost and
can sometimes be 10x slower than the "esbuild" package, so you may also not
want to do that.

  // This code below guards against the unlikely case that the user is using

  // the "preferUnplugged" setting. If that's the case, then the path to the
  // binary executable that we got above isn't actually a real path. Instead
  // it's a path to a zip file with some extra stuff appended to it.
  //
  // Yarn's PnP mode tries hard to patch Node's file system APIs to pretend
  // that these fake paths are real. So we can't check whether it's a real file
  // or not by using Node's file system APIs (e.g. "fs.existsSync") because
  // they have been patched to lie. But we can't return this fake path because
  // Yarn hasn't patched "child_process.execFileSync" to work with fake paths,
  // so attempting to execute the binary will fail.
  //
  // As a hack, we use Node's file system APIs to copy the file from the fake
  // path to a real path. This will cause Yarn's hacked file system to extract
  // the binary executable from the zip file and turn it into a real file that
  // we can execute.
  //
  // This is only done when both ".zip/" is present in the path and the
  // "pnpapi" package is present, which is a strong indication that Yarn PnP is
  // being used. There is no API at all for telling whether something is a real
  // file or not as far as I can tell. Even Yarn's own code just checks for
  // whether ".zip/" is present in the path or not.
  //
  // Note to self: One very hacky way to tell if a path is under the influence
  // of Yarn's file system hacks is to stat the file and check for the "crc"
  // property in the result. If that's present, then the file is inside a zip
